From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

*Flynn's taxonomy* is a classification of computer architectures, proposed by Michael J. Flynn in 1966.[1][2] The classification system has stuck, and has been used as a tool in design of modern processors and their functionalities. Since the rise of multiprocessing central processing units (CPUs), a multiprogramming context has evolved as an extension of the classification system.
